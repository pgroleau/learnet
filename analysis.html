        <h2>King Lear Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          <em>If you are unfamiliar with the plot of King Lear it is recommended that you read the <a href="summary.html">Summary page</a> for context before reading this page. It may also be helpful to visit our <a href="theories-of-compassion.html">Theories of Compassion page</a> ahead of time as well.</em>

        <p>
          To understand and learn from the mistakes of <em>King Lear</em> we must first understand the underlying dramatic structure of the play. <em>King Lear</em>  is a tragedy and a tragedy, as is defined by Aristotle, is an “imitation of an action” that excites pity and fear (Aristotle, <em>Poetics</em>). So, to avoid tragedy, we must avoid actions that excite pity and fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aristotle defines Fear as “a pain or disturbance due to a mental picture of some destructive or painful evil in the future” (Aristotle, <em>Rhetoric</em>). He defines pity as “a feeling of pain caused by the sight of some evil, destructive or painful, which befalls one who does not deserve it, and which we might expect to befall ourselves or some friend of ours, and moreover to befall us soon” (Aristotle, <em>Rhetoric</em>). 
        </p>
        <p>
          So what action then, did Lear commit to arouse these emotions? Aristotle says that the tragic hero experiences misfortune because of “some error or frailty” of character (Aristotle, <em>Poetics</em>). Lear is a vain man, wholly self-interested, and unable to accept well-intended criticism. He prefers insincere flattery to duty-bound honesty, a flaw Kent points out when he says, “...duty shall have dread to speak / When power to flattery bows?” (<em>KL</em> 1.1.144-145). A student of tragedy would cite Lear’s self-centeredness as his “fatal flaw.” 
        </p>
        <p>
          Lear’s vanity prompts him to banish Cordelia for he can’t process a world in which he is not the center of everyone’s affections. We pity Cordelia for this banishment. She is wholly rejected and disowned by her father and it is a rejection which she does not deserve. Moreover, this banishment evokes that special kind of emotion where the audience can put themselves in Cordelia’s shoes and imagine and fear what it’s like to be rejected by a loved one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feelings of pity and fear and not unique to Cordelia however. A recurring theme of the play is the rejection of a loved one. Edmund, due to his status as a bastard, is not loved by his father in the same manner as his legitimate half-brother. Lear, is rejected in his retirement by his daughters who force him out into a horrifying storm. Why do family members reject each other? What, psychologically, causes people to impede compassionate behavior?
        </p>
        <p>
          Two studies may have the answer. The first study, conducted by researchers at the University of Amsterdam and UCLA Berkeley found that people in positions of power are less likely to exhibit feelings of <em>emotional reciprocity</em> and <em>emotional complementarity</em> when compared to low power individuals (van Kleef 1320). More in-depth definitions of those terms can be found on our <a href="theories-of-compassion.html">Theories of Compassion page</a>, but in short <em>emotional reciprocity</em> and <em>emotional complementarity</em> are both related to one’s ability to recognize distress in another person and feel the same or similar emotions back (van Kleef 1315). As a high powered individual, Lear is psychologically predisposed to have difficulty caring about the emotions of others. This phenomenon also may explain why Gloucester cannot pick up on his own son Edmund’s distress when Gloucester makes jokes about Edmund’s status as a bastard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other study, published in <span class="ul">Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly</span> is concerned with the phenomenon of compassion fatigue, or emotional burnout where one becomes numb to the distress of others (Kinnick 688). The study found that people are more likely to feel compassion fatigue to issues “which are perceived by many to have low personal salience, and reflect perceptions that victims are to blame for their situations” (Kinnick 702). Thus Goneril and Regan, feel no compassion or duty to shelter Lear and his knights for they feel Lear himself is to blame for his poor situation. Regan states this feeling explicitly when she says “The injuries that [Lear and his train] procure / Must be their schoolmasters” (<em>KL</em> 3.1.298-299).
        </p>
        <p>
          To recap, King Lear is a tragedy. Tragedies are brought about by actions that excite feelings of pity and fear. Tragedies are caused because of a “tragic flaw” or frailty of character. Lear’s tragic flaw is that he is self-centered and vain and his vanity makes him unable to accept well-intentioned criticism. Lear lashes out and refuses to offer compassion or empathy for those who don’t placate his fragile ego and as a result experiences tragedy. How then, does an audience learn from their mistakes? Well, the simple answer is they must be aware of their ego. They must be conscious of insecurities that impede their ability to feel compassion towards their loved ones. Has Lear done this, he would have been comfortably enjoying retirement in the home of his favorite daughter Cordelia. Instead, her broken, lifeless body lies dead at his feet.
