        <h2>King Lear Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The tragedy King Lear is a story about an aging king who is divvying up his inheritance to his three daughters Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia. Eager to retire, Lear decides he will award the largest share of his land to the daughter who claims to love him the most. The two oldest daughters, Regan and Goneril, placate Lear and use saccharine speech to flatter their father in a bid for his inheritance. Lear’s youngest (and favorite) daughter Cordelia, however, stands by principle and refuses to overstate her love for her father. Her explanation for this honest description of her love is that she is duty-bound to give half of her love to her future husband (<em>KL</em> 1.1.94-101). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Distraught, Lear banishes Cordelia who then heads to France with her future husband, the King of France. Kent, an Earl, and friend of Lear objects to Lear’s cruel treatment of Cordelia and Kent too is also banished by Lear. Finally, Lear announces his intentions to retire and to spend half of his time at Regan’s estate and the other half of his time at Goneril’s estate.

          You can find a good performance of Act 1 Scene 1 (which sets up the main conflict of the play) in the embedded video below:

      </p>
      <p>
        As Lear begins his retirement, another conflict is introduced. Edmund, the bastard son of the Earl of Gloucester forges a note claiming his half-brother (and legitimate heir to the earldom) Edgar is planning on murdering their father. Upon seeing this note, Gloucester is enraged, forcing Edgar to flee to the countryside where he dons the disguise of a destitute beggar (a “Poor Tom”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Lear, meanwhile is shunned and shut out from Regan and Goneril’s estates. He, his Fool, and Kent (in disguise as a simple workman) descend out onto the heath during a great storm and take shelter in a shed where they find Edgar disguised as Poor Tom.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the coast, Cordelia and the armies of France have invaded England. Edmund betrays his father Gloucester to Lear’s daughters, claiming Gloucester knew of this invasion. As a result, Gloucester is arrested and Lear’s daughters gouge out his eyes. Regan’s husband Cornwall is killed by a servant, enraged at the torture of Gloucester. Finally, Gloucester is sent out to the heath where he is discovered by his son Edgar still in disguise as Poor Tom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lear is led by Kent back to the French army and Lear’s daughter Cordelia, while Gloucester attempts to commit suicide by jumping off the cliffs of Dover, but is “saved” by his son Edgar who tricks him into not jumping. Albany denounces Regan and Goneril’s treatment of Gloucester, which prompts Goneril to write a letter to Edmund encouraging him to murder her husband.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goneril’s servant Oswald sets off to find Edmund but discovers Edgar and Gloucester first. Oswald tries to kill Gloucester but is defeated by Edgar who finds Goneril’s murder letter on Oswald’s corpse. Edgar then gives this letter to Albany, revealing to the man that his wife is plotting to murder him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The British and French forces fight and the British win, capturing both Lear and Cordelia. Regan is poisoned by Goneril and dies offstage while Edgar, whose identity is hidden in armor, challenges Edmund to a duel. Edgar is victorious and Edmund is mortally wounded. Edgar then reveals his identity while Goneril exits the stage and later commits suicide. Edmund, with his dying breath, gives an order to prevent the execution of Lear and Cordelia but is too late. Lear survives, but Cordelia is hanged. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With a distraught and grief-stricken Lear, the play ends with the implication that Edgar will become king.
