        <h2>Theories of Compassion</h2>
        <p>
          Before we can understand <em>King Lear</em>, we must first understand two psychological theories of compassion which underpin all of the play’s conflicts. These two psychological phenomena explain why the interpersonal relationships within the play are so wrought with conflict.
        </p>
        <h3>Power and Compassion</h3>
        <p>
          The first of these psychological phenomena we must understand are <em>emotional reciprocity</em> and <em>emotional complementarity</em>. The article <span class="ul">Power, Distress, and Compassion Turning a Blind Eye to the Suffering of Others</span> details a study in which researchers examined how social power affects <em>emotional reciprocity</em> and <em>emotional complementarity</em>. Those terms are defined as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <em>Emotional reciprocity</em> refers to the process by which one individual comes to feel the emotions of another, as when one person's distress arouses distress in another. <em>Emotional complementarity</em> occurs when one person's emotions evoke different but corresponding emotions in others, as when one person's distress arouses compassion in another. (van Kleef 1315).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The researchers discovered that those with high social power exhibited both less <em>emotional reciprocity</em> and <em>emotional complementarity</em> when compared to low power individuals (van Kleef 1320). It is not suprising then when a character like Lear, who has arguably the highest social power at the start of the play, is also a selfish and self-centered man who has little concern for the emotions of others.
        </p>
        <h3>Compassion Fatigue</h3>
        <p>
          Another psychological phenomena we must understand is <em>compassion fatigue</em>. The article <span class="ul">Compassion Fatigue: Communication and Burnout Toward Social Problems</span> details a study in which researchers determined some of the principal reasons for why people experience <em>compassion fatigue</em>. <em>Compassion fatigue</em> is defined as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The best parallel to <em>compassion fatigue</em> as it is conceptualized here is found in the literature related to emotional burnout in the helping professions, in which subjects become increasingly desensitized to those they are supposed to help. This burnout is characterized as a pattern of emotional overload and subsequent emotional exhaustion. (Kinnick 688).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        Of the many reasons why individuals experience <em>compassion fatigue</em> the reason most relevant for the study of <em>King Lear</em> is issue-dependent nature of this type of emotional burnout. The study found that certain issues “which are perceived by many to have low personal salience, and reflect perceptions that victims are to blame for their situations” are more likely engender <em>compassion fatigue</em> than other issues (Kinnick 702). Thus one explanation for the coldness of Lear’s daughters towards their father’s plight is simply that they feel as though Lear brought his misfortune upon himself. 
        </p>
        <p>
        To recap, two psychological studies found that high power individuals are less likely to exhibit <em>emotional reciprocity</em> or <em>emotional complementarity</em> and that certain issues&mdash;especially issues in which the victim is perceived to be of blame for their own misfortune&mdash;are more likely to produce <em>compassion fatigue</em>.
