        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Families are not always supportive, loving, or free-of-murder. Family conflict can be better understood by studying the mistakes of the family of King Lear. Hindsight, of course, is 2020 and, though Lear only learned from his mistakes before it was too late, it doesn’t mean we can’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learnet.com is an online resource examining the tragedy of King Lear, its points of tension, how those points created an environment of resentment which could not be resolved. By understanding the story of King Lear, we can (hopefully) resolve family conflict and create a network of friendship free from hurt feelings or gouged eyes.
       </p>
       <h3>The Problems</h3>
